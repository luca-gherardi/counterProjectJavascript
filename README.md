# counterProjectJavascript

 This project is a JavaScript app which works like a counter.
 
 I realized it for the "Basics JavaScript Course" of https://www.start2impact.it
 
 The app contains 4 buttons:
 
 "AUMENTA" = INCREASE: pushing this button the value of the counter increases.
 
 "DECREMENTA" = DECREASE: pushing this button the value of the counter decreases.
 
 "AZZERA" = CLEAR: pushing this button the value of the counter resets.
 
 "INSERISCI" = INSERT: pushing this button you can enter the starting value of the counter.
